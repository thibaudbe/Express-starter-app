# Express-starter-app

Added Bower, Swig engine, Mongoose, session, ...

Demo build with [Expressjs generator](http://expressjs.com/guide.html). I've modified Jade engine for [Swig](http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/docs) that looks like prety close to Jinja2 in Python, and added [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) for session logging.


## Config

Make sure you have Express, MongoDB, and bower installed. Then install dependencies

	cd myapp && npm install 

And run your app

	npm start

In another terminal window, run the mongoDB database

	mongod
